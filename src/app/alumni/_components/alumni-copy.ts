        "Reesav Rokka first learned about Naaya Aayam Multi-Disciplinary Institute (NAMI) through his friends and educational counselors. They spoke highly of its quality education, supportive environment, and practical approach to learning. At the time, Reesav wanted to build a career in Information Technology (IT), and he felt NAMI would give him the practical skills and foundation he needed rather than focusing only on textbook knowledge.",

His growth came not only from classroom lessons but also from projects, presentations, and group assignments. These experiences taught him problem-solving, communication, teamwork, leadership, and how to listen to others. He came to understand that technical knowledge alone was not enough for a successful career.",

His role involves managing the hospital's technology systems, protecting information, managing software, supporting digital projects, and working with doctors, nurses, administrators, and other staff to solve practical problems through technology.",

What matters most to him is seeing how these technological improvements can help staff access information faster, work more accurately, and provide better services to patients.",
        "Looking back, Reesav sees a strong connection between his education and his career. Presentations gave me confidence, group projects taught me collaboration, and practical assignments prepared him to solve real-world problems. He believes students should use every classroom activity as preparation for their future, while also continuing to learn because technology constantly changes.",

We went through something much bigger than academics when the GEN-Z protests affected our NAMI community, and our college was completely burned down. Seeing a place that held so many memories for us being destroyed was heartbreaking. But what I remember even more is how quickly everyone came together and moved forward. NAMI continued despite everything, and it showed me that a college is not just a building. It is the people, the memories, and the spirit that make it special.",
